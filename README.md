# GDPRtEXT

A glossary of GDPR concepts serialised using [SKOS][https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/] and a linked dataset of GDPR text serialised using [RDF][https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/].

The ontology and its documentation is available at [https://w3id.org/GDPRtEXT][https://w3id.org/GDPRtEXT]

## Overview

GDPRtEXT has two goals:

1. Enable representing text of GDPR as a Linked Open Data resource with granular access to its clauses
2. Provide a glossary of terms associated with GDPR

For this, it provides a RDF dataset of GDPR text with individual ids assigned to each of its clauses. It also provides a SKOS glossary of terms from the text with references to relevant clauses.

The canonical GDPR text can be found [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1499685310592&from=en).
