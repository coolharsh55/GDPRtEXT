<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is comprised of several articles,
each with points that refer to specific concepts. 
The general convention of referring to these points and concepts is to quote 
the specific article or point using a human-readable reference. 
This ontology provides a way to refer to the points within the GDPR using the 
[European Legislation Identifier](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/eli/index.html)
ontology published by the European Publication Office. 
It also defines the concepts relevant or defined by the GDPR 
using the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) ontology.
